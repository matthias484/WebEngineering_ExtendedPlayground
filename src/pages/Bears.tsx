            <h1>The Trouble with Bears</h1>
            <p>
                Tall, lumbering, angry, dangerous. The real live bears of this world are proud, independent creatures, self-serving, and always on the hunt for food.
            </p>
            <h2>Types of Bears</h2>
            <p>
                Bears come in two varieties â€” large and medium. You don't get small bears. If you have seen a small bear, it was probably a cub.

                    <img src={wildBear} alt="Wild Bear" />
                    <p>
                        Wild bears eat a variety of meat, fish, fruit, nuts, and other naturally growing ingredients. They tend to live in relative isolation, in caves or forests.

                    <img src={urbanBear} alt="Urban Bear" />
                    <p>
                        Urban bears scavenge from readily available urban food outlets like dumpsters and fast food joints.
